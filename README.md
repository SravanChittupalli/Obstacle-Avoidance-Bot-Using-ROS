# Obstacle-Avoidance-Using-ROS-And-Gazebo

This project contains a bot simulation in Gazebo which can avoid obstacles. The robot design and other requirements can be found in this [PDF](assignment.pdf)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository in the `src` folder of your `catkin` workspace
2. Run `catkin_make`
3. Launch your terminal and run the command `roslaunch exercise2 bot.launch`. 
This will launch and load the robot in the gazebo enviroment
4. In another terminal, run the command `rosrun exercise2 cmd_bot` to start the robot and begin the obstacle avoidance course.
